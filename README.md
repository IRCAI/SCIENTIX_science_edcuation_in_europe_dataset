## Desired Outcomes

Participants are expected to use the suruvey results to understand the data better. The full report compiled with the 
data is found [here](resources/Scientix-full-resport-2018.pdf). 

However, detailed analysis of data coming from different countries (e.g. like Slovenia, Portugal, France or Italy) 
is not conducted and is very valuable for understanding the data in the local context.
